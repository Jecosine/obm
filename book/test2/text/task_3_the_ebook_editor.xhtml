  <h2 class="center" id="task3">Task 3: The e-book editor</h2>

  <p>Calibre includes a tool specifically for editing e-books. The e-book editor supports the EPUB and AZW3 formats. Right click any book in your library and select ‘Edit book’ to open the editor.</p>

  <p>The editor is very useful if there are typos you wish to correct or layout changes you’d like to make. It’s invaluable when trying to clean up a book that just won’t convert quite how you want. Don’t be fooled though, the editor isn’t only for simple tasks, it’s capable of handling even the most complex of layouts.</p>

  <p>In addition to including the features you’d expect from a text editor (syntax highlighting, line numbers, and regular expression based find/replace) it also supports a large number of features specific to e-books:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Live preview</li>

    <li>Table of contents editor</li>

    <li>Embedded font support including subsetting</li>

    <li>Smarten punctuation</li>

    <li>Remove unused CSS</li>

    <li>Error checking</li>

    <li>Much, much more</li>
  </ul>
