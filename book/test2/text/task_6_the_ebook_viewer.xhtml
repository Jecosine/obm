  <h2 class="center" id="task6">Task 6: The e-book viewer</h2>

  <p>I’ve hinted that calibre has the ability to view e-books too. All you need to do is select the e-book you want to read and click the ‘View’ button in the tool bar to have calibre open the e-book in calibre’s e-book viewer. The viewer supports everything you might expect such as bookmarks and navigation via the table of contents (if the e-book has one). The viewer, however, cannot read e-books protected with DRM.</p>
